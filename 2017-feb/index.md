### Max Ogden
* Talk: Mass downloading HTTP archives with Node
* Description: Lately Max has been writing modules to save and archive tons of scientific data that's doomed to be lost or [sealed up away from the public](https://twitter.com/denormalize/status/831581871230193664). Max walked us through the tools it took to get and store the bulk public data/metadata. He also talked about related organizations he's teaming up with to maintain this initiative.

## Reflection, thoughts
* The new room is very open and has a great combination of table and couch seating. There's a LOT of potential to utilize the room for more involved and/or interactive presentations, as well as determine and document an optimal seating setup for keeping people close and engaged with the presenter (it's a big room!). It would be ideal to find the balance between keeping space available further back at the tables so people can hack, but just not far enough away that anyone would feel disconnected.
* With our first remote talk: Ben Acker's effervescent personality carried through and the talk felt personal even via videochat. I think keeping aa good balance of amazing/engaging remote speakers and great local speakers will keep people inspired, and get others interested in joining in.
* The group felt relaxed enough to ask Max questions throughout the his presentation, this is a big win for the ethos in our group we hope to support.
* Needed improvements: Diversify our speaker selection as much as possible.
