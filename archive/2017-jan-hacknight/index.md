## Meetup notes
* First launch of the new PDXNode hack night!
* Great attendance for only sending out a group email with no official meetup calendar event. We had somewhere between 15â€“20 people (I need to start actually counting moving forward).
* Ctrl-h was very accomodating for our one-off scheduled meetup. The environment was amazing for new devs who'd never experienced a hackerspace like this before. Hoping to talk further with Ctrl-h about possible meetups for moving forward. We're still working out if this hack night is going to happen monthly, or every other month, and where.
* Attendees seemed very happy to have the time to work on things they normally wouldn't have the time to do mostly, even more so than sharing their current projects or starting a group project.
* I (@obensource) demoed an early iteration of my 'midi-radio' Websound project help inspire people to share next time since no one volunteered this time.

## Setup
* We originally intended on splitting the room up based on regions (starting with node, individual hacking, group hacking), but the size of the group made it clear that keeping everyone together in one location would be more inviting and fun for everyone.

## Reflections, Improvements to be made
* A low-pressure environment is crucial to the success of this hack night where people feel safe to grow with the help of others or just hack on what they want to do.
* Even though we presented the idea of organzied spaces for solo or group hacking, and starting with Node for the first time, the size of the group made individual project hacking and hanging out more natural.
* It would probably be advantageous to actively talk with and help code school graduates/graduate-candidates, and total newbies to search and get started on contributing to opensource projects that coincide with their career goals. There is a lot of room for improvement here.
* There's room to get people excited about demoing their projects in their various states to get others excited about helping out or starting their own and showing them off.
* Make sure we have vegetarian/vegan options for atendees next time, and map out a good strategy for food.
