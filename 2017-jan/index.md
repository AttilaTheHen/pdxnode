## Meetup Notes
* First meeting at Vacasa! We had quite a bit of back and forth as to whether this meetup would actually happen: with inital rescheduling due to inclement weather, and near cancellation due to complications with the venue and borrowed projector. But it did! And we **still** had a great turn out regardless! (~25-30 in attendance).
* Enthusiastic and attentive audience. 

## Presenters

### Ben Michel
* Talk: The Pragmatics of becoming a Junior Developer
* Description: There's a lot of essential skills to learn as a new developer that are fairly unclear, until you're thrown into the deep-end. This talk aims to help the transition be a little less jarring for you.
* Slides: http://slides.com/oben/deck-2#/

### JD Duncan
* Talk: Database Jones
* Description: The Database Jones package provides a fast, easy, and safe framework for building database applications in Node.js. It is organized around the concept of a database session, which allows standard JavaScript objects to be read from and written to a database.

## Reflection, thoughts
* General: The past few meetups have been very positive and attendance is maintaining well. The new wave of pdxnode continues to bring Portland's node community together, and it's very exciting!
* Presentations improvement: prioritize lining up quality talks that are educational and of interest to the entire group.
* Cultural improvement: We seem to attract a fair amount of junior/senior developers, hiring representatives, and code-school graduates who're trying to make their way into the industry. The graduates just want to start working right away. The hiring reps are generally looking for individuals with more experience than the graduates, and have a hard time getting the juniors/seniors interested in the positions they're offering. If we can encourage mentorship both in the quality of talks given, and with the invitation to experienced developers to become mentors to the graduates, and get the graduates to attend our new hack-nights and work on opensource projectsâ€“over time they'll most likely have a better chance at finding work they want, which helps everyone in our community. We should also make more of a consorted effort to invite people from great companies to talk about open positions they have for experienced developers and/or mentor-friendly positions for entry-level positions. We will definitely continue to encourage hiring representatives to talk about their open positions as well, they have been and continue to be a positive influence on the group both in job offerings and sponsorship.
