Portland, OR's very own Node.js usergroup/meetup.

Join our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/) group, and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pdxnode)!

### We use github to submit talks: lightning, long-form, and otherwise.

See [the lightning talk](./talk-templates/lightning-talk-template.md) and [longform talk](./talk-templates/talk-template.md)
templates for more details on submitting a talk proposal!

See [the request for talks](./talk-templates/request-for-talk.md) to submit what you'd love to experience at
our meetup.

Come talk to us in [#pdxnode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pdxnode&uio=d4) on freenode.

#### for organizers:

For each meetup, make a new directory with an `index.md` at least a month or two in advance --
name the directory in the style, `2017-jan`. Once the talks for the meetup are finalized, put
the lineup in `index.md` with relative links to the talks.
